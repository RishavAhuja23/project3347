        <h2>Welcome to the World of Natural Resources!</h2>
        <p>Natural resources are materials or substances that occur in nature and can be used for economic gain. They include water, minerals, forests, and fossil fuels. These resources are vital for the survival and development of human civilizations. For instance, water is essential for drinking, agriculture, and sanitation. Minerals are used in various industries, from construction to technology, while forests provide oxygen, timber, and are home to diverse wildlife.</p>
        <p>The responsible management and conservation of natural resources are crucial for sustainable development. As the global population continues to grow, the demand for these resources increases, leading to over-exploitation and environmental degradation. Therefore, it is important to find a balance between utilizing resources for economic development and preserving them for future generations.</p>
