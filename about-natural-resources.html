        <h2>What are Natural Resources?</h2>
        <p>Natural resources are resources that exist without any actions of humankind. They include sunlight, air, water, minerals, plants, and animals.</p>
        <h3>Types of Natural Resources</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Forests:</strong> Forests are vital for life on Earth. They provide timber, oxygen, habitats for wildlife, and help in maintaining the ecological balance. Forests also play a crucial role in the water cycle and act as carbon sinks, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</li>
            <li><strong>Minerals:</strong> Minerals are naturally occurring substances found in the Earth's crust. They are used in various industries, including construction, manufacturing, and technology. Common minerals include iron, copper, gold, and diamonds. These minerals are essential for making tools, machinery, electronics, and jewelry.</li>
            <li><strong>Sun:</strong> The sun is a primary source of energy for Earth. Solar energy is harnessed using solar panels to generate electricity, heat water, and power various devices. Sunlight is also crucial for photosynthesis, the process by which plants produce food and oxygen.</li>
            <li><strong>Water:</strong> Water is essential for all forms of life. It is used for drinking, agriculture, sanitation, and industrial processes. Freshwater resources include rivers, lakes, and groundwater, while saltwater is found in oceans and seas. Conserving water and ensuring its quality are vital for sustaining life and ecosystems.</li>
            <li><strong>Rocks:</strong> Rocks are solid mineral material forming part of the surface of the Earth and other similar planets. They are used in construction (building stones), for extracting minerals (mining), and in some cases, as fuel (coal).</li>
            <li><strong>Animals:</strong> Animals provide food (meat, milk, eggs), clothing (wool, leather), and are also important for ecological balance. They play crucial roles in food chains and ecosystems, pollination, and seed dispersal.</li>
            <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Soil is a natural resource that supports plant life and agriculture. It is a mixture of minerals, organic matter, gases, liquids, and countless organisms. Soil provides nutrients for plants and is essential for growing food.</li>
            <li><strong>Air:</strong> Air is a vital resource for all living organisms. It contains oxygen, which is necessary for respiration, and carbon dioxide, which plants use for photosynthesis. Clean air is crucial for health and the environment.</li>
        </ul>
